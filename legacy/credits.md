## Credits

### General

Catharina Hippius, René Williams, and Frank Würthner generously provided
a sample dataset which is included in a demo project. The global and
target analysis of these data is described in Figures 5-9 of:

- C. Hippius, I.H.M. van Stokkum, E. Zangrando, R.M. Williams, and F. Würthner. Excited state interactions in calix\[4\]arene-perylene bisimide dye conjugates: Global and target analysis of supramolecular building blocks. [Journal of Physical Chemistry C, 111(37):13988-13996, 2007](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp0733825 "wikilink").

The many people who have reported bugs over the years, either by e-mail
